# covid_visualization
Repository of school and independent work surrounding COVID-19.

This started as a place to share work done in conjunction with Jade Chia-Chun, Sirak Ghebremusse, and Don Moon for a project as part of UC Berkeley's MIDS program.

All code included was written by me, either for that project or as independent work.

Our project is available here: https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~sirak/final_project_w209/examples/pages/

My Tableau Visualizations that were used as part of this work are available here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/henry.bazakas#!/
